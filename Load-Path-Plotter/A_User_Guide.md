# User Guide

## Matlab Load Path Plotting Algorithm Version 1

### January 2019

### Plotting Load Paths for mesh and stress files using the Hex8 3D finite
#### D. Kelly, G. Pearce and K. Schroder-Turner

This User Guide describes features of the MatLab program prepared for release at the AIAA SciCom 2019 Conference, San Diego 7-11 January 2019 [1]. The program reads mesh data and stresses from text files created by a finite element solution that is run independently by the user. It then defines the vector field and plots the load paths using the Runge-Kutta algorithm described in the paper.

The MatLab application can be downloaded from the GitHub website https://GitHub/GarthPearce/LoadPathMATLAB

The site contains the source of the program, and a number of example sets of data.
