Add any changes that you can think of here and I'll do my best to implementing them.

1. Finish commenting and cleaning.
2. Vectorise the modules to accept 2D and 3D so there are no more psuedo-duplicate files.
3. Set up framework to iterate over many time histories
4. Add option to change the plotting from a line to a dot that varies colour with intensity.
5. Separate pre-processing from solving
6. Add ray-casting solver back as optional.
7. Add in data preprocessing check at GUI for the max path length (needs to be integer)
8. Fix NaN bug in plotter
9. Fix file path resetting in GUI
