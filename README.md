# Matlab Load Path Plotting Algorithm

This README.md describes features of the MATLAB program prepared for release at the AIAA SciCom 2019 Conference, San Diego 7-11 January 2019 [1]. The program reads mesh data and stresses from text files created by a finite element solution that is run independently by the user. It then defines the vector field and plots the load paths using the Runge-Kutta algorithm described in the paper.

# Installation

The repository can be cloned or downloaded from GitHub:

![Load Path Plotter](https://github.com/GarthPearce/LoadPathMATLAB)

Once the files have been downloaded, change to the directory where the files are contained and run the &quot;LoadPathGUI.m&quot; file. You will see the GUI pop up:
